# Blades Discord Bot
A Discord Bot to make progress clocks for the Blades in the Dark roleplaying game

### Installation and Usage
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using https://github.com/ZebSK/Blades-Discord-Bot.git
2. Install dependencies using
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
3. Create a Discord Bot using the Discord Developer Portal at https://discord.com/developers/applications. From here, generate a token for your bot and a link to add it to a discord server
5. Rename .env.example to .env and replace the token value with your own
```
TOKEN = "YOUR_OWN_BOT_TOKEN"
```
6. Add the bot to your server and run the run.py file. This may take a while for Discord to add the commands to the bot the first time you run the code
